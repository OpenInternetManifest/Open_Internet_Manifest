# DID (Decentralized Identifier)

Decentralized identifier – a unique, self-managed ID that you can use everywhere without an intermediary.

Examples:
- did:key – simple key-based DID
- did:web – DID based on a domain name
- did:plc – used by Bluesky for portable accounts
- Microsoft ION (Identity Overlay Network) – Bitcoin-based DID layer

Enables portable identity without dependence on a company.
