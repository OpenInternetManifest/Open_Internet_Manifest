# Thesis 4

The [**enclosures**](/EN/concepts/enclosures) are almost complete, but the last gate is still open — and they know it.

The five [**gatekeepers**](/EN/concepts/gatekeepers) are hammering day and night: [**app stores**](/EN/concepts/app-store) are becoming stricter fortresses, [**independent protocols**](/EN/concepts/independent-protocols) are being starved, [**open hardware**](/EN/concepts/open-hardware) is being banned or made unaffordable.

Yet alternative networks, free servers, [**open-source operating systems**](/EN/concepts/open-source-operating-system), and communities still operate outside their reach.

We stand on the narrowest edge of history: the moment when [**collective exit**](/EN/concepts/collective-exit) is still possible — and when we can choose together to tear that gate open forever.
