# Sovereign Node – The key to taking back the internet

A [**sovereign node**](#) is not a gadget.  
It is an act of resistance.

It is a Raspberry Pi, an old laptop, a mini-server or a NAS running 24/7 in your meter cupboard, attic or under your desk, declaring:

“I own my own piece of the internet.  
Not Microsoft.  
Not the government.  
Not the cloud provider.  
I do.”

### Technical definition
A device that:
• is fully managed by you (no remote management by anyone else),  
• is permanently connected to the open internet or a [**mesh network**](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/concepts/mesh-network),  
• runs open protocols ([**IPFS**](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/concepts/ipfs) · [**Matrix**](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/concepts/matrix) · [**Nostr**](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/concepts/nostr) · [**Yggdrasil**](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/concepts/yggdrasil) · [**LoRa**](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/concepts/lora) · etc.),  
• stores your data locally and makes it available to others,  
• keeps working as soon as you plug it back in — no one else required.

### What happens if we do this en masse?
If 35 % of Dutch households run a sovereign node (3 million nodes with 4 TB each), we create 12 exabytes of distributed storage.  
More than enough for all Dutch data traffic — many times over.

The hyperscale data centres in Wieringermeer, Hollands Kroon and the Eemshaven?  
Technically and economically redundant.  
Politically a naked power grab.

### Local mesh networks in the Netherlands (2025 – already real and growing)
- **Amsterdam Mesh** – >600 nodes on rooftops and balconies, completely independent of Ziggo/KPN  
- **Freifunk Friesland / Drenthe** – hundreds of nodes in rural areas  
- **Guifi-net Twente** – 200+ nodes in the Achterhoek, often faster
