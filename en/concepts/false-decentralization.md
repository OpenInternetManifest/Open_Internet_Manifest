# False decentralization

“Decentralization” offered by gatekeepers themselves within their own platform.

Classic example: [Meta's Threads on ActivityPub](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/21/networking-traffic/threads-has-entered-the-fediverse/) – it appears federated, but Meta retains full control over accounts, moderation, and data, with limited integration (no full 2-way federation as of 2025).

It looks open, but remains under their control — more luxurious cells in the same prison.
