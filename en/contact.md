# Contact & Join

The Open Internet Manifest is a small, organic movement. We don’t have a helpdesk or large organization – but we do have an open door for anyone who wants to build along.

We appreciate every comment, question, idea, or piece of criticism. Here are the ways to get in touch:

### 1. Matrix (recommended – decentralized & private)
Join our open space:  
[#openinternetmanifest:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#openinternetmanifest:matrix.org)

- End-to-end encrypted  
- No central server watching  
- Type the thesis number or topic as your first message  

No Matrix account yet? Download Element (free app) – it takes 1 minute.

### 2. Email (for private or serious contributions)
Send a message to: **openinternetmanifest@proton.me**  

- ProtonMail: encrypted, no IP logging, zero-knowledge  
- We reply personally, no auto-replies  
- Use this for: thesis ideas, node tips, collaborations, or if Matrix isn’t possible  

### 3. Public discussion
- Reply directly under every thesis or RVN post via Giscus (no login required)  
- That’s the fastest way to contribute visibly  

We keep it simple and decentralized: no forms, no trackers, no mandatory fields.  
You decide how much and how you share.

**Want to help build?**  
- Suggest a thesis idea  
- Test a guide and give feedback  
- Contribute via Decap CMS (GitHub repo)  
- Share the site in your circle  

This is your manifesto – the more hands, the stronger it becomes.

See you in the space or inbox.
