# The Guides are Living

This is not an end  
This is a beginning

These are all the guides for now

But it doesn’t stop here.  
Never.

This manifesto is **living**.  
These guides are **living**.  
It is a commons, a shared garden that grows as long as we keep building on it.

The following guides are already in the works.  
Some by me.  
Some by you.

Want to co-write?  
Want to submit a guide or thesis, add a concept, make a translation, issue a declaration, or build a sovereign node?

Then you’re exactly in the right place.

→ [Contribute to the manifesto](https://github.com/OpenInternetManifest/issues/new/choose)  
→ [Issue your declaration](/en/declarations/template-declaration)  
→ [Join the discussion](#openinternetmanifest:matrix.org)  
→ [Read more when part 2 is ready](/en/manifest)

This manifesto only ends when the internet is once again fully open, neutral, and inalienable.

And that moment is up to us together.

Thank you for coming this far.  
Now it’s up to you.
