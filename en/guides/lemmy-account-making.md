# Guide – Create your first Lemmy account (Reddit alternative)

Lemmy is the decentralized alternative to Reddit: forums (sublemmies), communities, and discussions — without a central owner or algorithm controlling your feed.

**Time:** 10–20 minutes  
**Cost:** €0

### Step 1 – Choose a server (instance)
<details>
<summary>I don't know which server to choose → click here</summary>

Good starters:
- <a href="https://lemmy.ml" target="_blank">lemmy.ml</a> – large general community
- <a href="https://beehaw.org" target="_blank">beehaw.org</a> – friendly, moderated, focus on positive discussions
- <a href="https://lemmy.world" target="_blank">lemmy.world</a> – largest instance, many communities

Or find an instance on <a href="https://join-lemmy.org/instances" target="_blank">join-lemmy.org/instances</a> (filter by language, size, or topic).
</details>

### Step 2 – Create an account
<details>
<summary>Step-by-step</summary>

1. Go to the website of your chosen server (e.g. lemmy.world)
2. Click “Sign Up” or “Register”
3. Fill in username, email (optional on some instances), and password
4. Answer the registration question (to prevent bots)
5. Verify your email (if required) → done!
</details>

### Step 3 – Set up your profile
<details>
<summary>Make it recognizable</summary>

- Use the same profile picture and bio as on Reddit
- Add your old Reddit handle in your bio (e.g. “Previously u/yourname on Reddit”)
- Pin a post: “Hello Lemmy! I’ve moved from Reddit.”
</details>

### Step 4 – Find and join communities
<details>
<summary>How do I find my old subreddits?</summary>

- Search for the subreddit name (e.g. r/technology → !technology@lemmy.world)
- Or use <a href="https://sub.rehab" target="_blank">sub.rehab</a> – list of Lemmy alternatives for popular subreddits
- Subscribe to communities across instances
</details>

### Step 5 – Make your first post
Post in a community or create your own sublemmy.

You are now outside the enclosure.
