# Guide – Create your first Mastodon account and migrate from X/Twitter

Mastodon is not a replacement for Twitter — it is better: you choose your own server, your data is yours, and you can always move.

**Time:** 15–30 minutes  
**Cost:** €0

### Step 1 – Choose a server (instance)
<details markdown="1">
<summary>I don't know which server to choose → click here</summary>

Good starters for English speakers:
- <a href="https://mastodon.social" target="_blank">mastodon.social</a> – large general community
- <a href="https://fosstodon.org" target="_blank">fosstodon.org</a> – focus on open-source and tech
- <a href="https://chaos.social" target="_blank">chaos.social</a> – active, free, and privacy-friendly

Or find a server on <a href="https://instances.social" target="_blank">instances.social</a> (filter by language, topic, or country).
</details>

### Step 2 – Create an account
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Step-by-step</summary>

1. Go to the website of your chosen server (e.g. mastodon.social)
2. Click “Sign up” or “Create account”
3. Fill in username, email, and password
4. Verify your email → done!
</details>

### Step 3 – Set up your profile
<details markdown="1">
<summary>Make it recognizable for your old followers</summary>

- Use the same profile picture and bio as on X/Twitter
- Add your old X/Twitter handle in your bio (e.g. “Previously @yourname on Twitter”)
- Pin a post: “Hello Mastodon! I’ve moved from Twitter. Follow me here.”
</details>

### Step 4 – Follow people
<details markdown="1">
<summary>How do I find my old followers?</summary>

- Use <a href="https://fedifinder.glitch.me" target="_blank">Fedifinder</a>: enter your X/Twitter handle → it finds Mastodon accounts of your followers
- Or search manually by name or handle
- Follow them — they get a notification
</details>

### Step 5 – Import your old posts (optional)
<details markdown="1">
<summary>I don't want to lose my old tweets</summary>

- Use Twitter archive or tools like <a href="https://twexport.github.io" target="_blank">Twexport</a> to download your tweets
- Upload them manually or use tools like <a href="https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br" target="_blank">Crossposter</a> for limited automatic import
</details>

### Step 6 – Start posting
Post your first message:  
“Hello Mastodon! I’ve moved from Twitter. Who do I know here?”

You are now outside the enclosure.
