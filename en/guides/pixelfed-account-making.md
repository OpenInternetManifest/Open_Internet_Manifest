# Guide – Create your first Pixelfed account (Instagram alternative)

Pixelfed is the decentralized alternative to Instagram: share photos, no algorithm controlling your feed, no ads, full data portability.

**Time:** 10–20 minutes  
**Cost:** €0

### Step 1 – Choose a server (instance)
<details markdown="1">
<summary>I don't know which server to choose → click here</summary>

Good starters:
- <a href="https://pixelfed.social" target="_blank">pixelfed.social</a> – large general community
- <a href="https://pixey.org" target="_blank">pixey.org</a> – privacy-focused
- <a href="https://pfed.eu" target="_blank">pfed.eu</a> – European, active

Or find an instance on <a href="https://fediverse.observer/explore/pixelfed" target="_blank">fediverse.observer</a> (filter by language or topic).

<details markdown="1">

</details>

### Step 4 – Follow people
<details markdown="1">
<summary>How do I find my old followers?</summary>

- Use <a href="https://fedifinder.glitch.me" target="_blank">Fedifinder</a>: enter your Instagram handle (if known) or search manually
- Or search by name or handle in Pixelfed
- Follow them — they get a notification

### Step 5 – Post your first photo
