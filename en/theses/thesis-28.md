# Thesis 28 – Demand interoperability from companies and governments

No more mandatory app to access a government service.

No Google or Apple account to vote, receive healthcare, or travel.

[**Open protocols**](/en/concepts/independent-protocols) and [**open standards**](/en/concepts/open-standards) instead of closed silos — that is the only real public digital infrastructure.

Start demanding what should have been legally required years ago.
