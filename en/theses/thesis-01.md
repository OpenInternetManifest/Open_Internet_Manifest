# Thesis 1

The internet is not dead; it has been captured by five [**gatekeepers**](/en/concepts/gatekeepers) who control 92% of our digital breath.

Where we once walked freely through an open field, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta now stand as armed feudal lords at every crossroads, collecting tolls on every step, every word, every thought.

They decide which paths are visible, which voices are heard, which devices are still allowed to speak to each other.

As long as their grip is not broken, [**digital sovereignty**](/en/concepts/digital-sovereignty) remains a fairy tale we tell our children while they grow up in [**walled gardens**](/en/concepts/walled-garden).
