# Thesis 3

In the real world, no one would accept what we have come to see as normal on the internet for years.

Imagine buying a house and immediately having five security firms install cameras in your bedroom and bathroom — and then having to pay to turn on the lights.

Imagine the postal service opening all your letters, copying them, and deciding whether your friend is allowed to read them.

Imagine a security company stopping you on the sidewalk and saying: “Only if you hand over your wallet and promise not to enter the wrong shops.”

Offline, we would explode with rage in the streets.  
Online, we click “[**accept button**](/en/concepts/accept-button)” and keep scrolling.

This normalization of [**surveillance**](/en/concepts/surveillance), [**data collection**](/en/concepts/data-collection), and [**access control**](/en/concepts/access-control) is not an accident — it is the greatest trick ever pulled on humanity.
