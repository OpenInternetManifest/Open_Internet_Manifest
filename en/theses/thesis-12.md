# Thesis 12 – Back to protocols that no one owns

Email, the world wide web, and IRC still work without a single company in charge.

New open protocols such as [**ActivityPub**](/en/concepts/activitypub) (Mastodon), [**Nostr**](/en/concepts/nostr), [**Matrix**](/en/concepts/matrix), and [**IPFS**](/en/concepts/ipfs) are ready for everyday use.

They are not perfect, but they belong to no one — and therefore can never be enclosed again.

Every day we use them more, the monopoly of the five [**gatekeepers**](/en/concepts/gatekeepers) becomes weaker.
