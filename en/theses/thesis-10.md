# Thesis 10

The digital cage is expanding into the real world — and we are helping to carry it ourselves.

What we have accepted online for years — mandatory accounts, permanent [**surveillance**](/en/concepts/surveillance), algorithms deciding what you may see or do — is slowly becoming normal in everyday life: digital passes for travel, apps that grant access to work or healthcare, systems from one company running government services and managing your data.

We are getting used to a single [**closed-source AI**](/en/concepts/closed-source-ai) becoming the gatekeeper of knowledge, news, and human interaction — not because it is inevitable, but because we confuse [**convenience**](/en/concepts/convenience) with freedom.

If we do not break this normalization now, the [**walled garden**](/en/concepts/walled-garden) will soon become the entire society.

Only a truly open internet can stop this expansion — by showing that a free digital world is still possible, and thereby giving the physical world breathing room again.
