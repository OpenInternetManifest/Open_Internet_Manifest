# Thesis 27 – Teach one person an open alternative this week

Your mother on [**Element**](/en/concepts/element).  
Your best friend on [**Mastodon**](/en/concepts/mastodon).  
Your neighbor on [**PeerTube**](/en/concepts/peertube).  
Your sister on [**ProtonMail**](/en/concepts/protonmail).

One person at a time is how every large network once started.

Your invitation today is tomorrow’s network effect.
