# Thesis 9

An open internet makes real economic freedom possible again, without five companies owning the toll roads.

In the past, you could build a website, offer a service, or start a community and earn money directly from people all over the world — without anyone skimming 15 to 30 percent of your revenue.

Today, you are a tenant of their marketplaces, advertising networks, and payment systems: they set the rules, visibility, and how much of your work actually reaches you.

That dependence keeps millions of creators, entrepreneurs, and small communities poor and vulnerable.

By building [**open protocols**](/en/concepts/independent-protocols), [**peer-to-peer payments**](/en/concepts/peer-to-peer-payments), and [**independent platforms**](/en/concepts/independent-platforms), we create an internet again where you can earn, trade, and collaborate — without a handful of [**gatekeepers**](/en/concepts/gatekeepers) deciding whether you are allowed to live from your own work.

**Want to pay peer-to-peer yourself?**  
The full step-by-step guide is coming → [Peer-to-peer payments – coming soon](/en/guides/peer-to-peer-payments-coming-soon)
