# Thesis 13 – Your data belongs to you, not to a platform

With [**Solid**](/en/concepts/solid) (Tim Berners-Lee), [**Nextcloud**](/en/concepts/nextcloud), [**ownCloud**](/en/concepts/owncloud), or your own [**IPFS node**](/en/concepts/ipfs), you decide where your photos, messages, and documents are stored.

You can take them with you, share them with whomever you want, and truly delete them when you want.

[**Data sovereignty**](/en/concepts/data-sovereignty) is not a luxury — it is the foundation of a free digital life.
