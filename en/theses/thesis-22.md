# Thesis 22 – Replace WhatsApp with Element (Matrix)

Download [**Element**](/en/concepts/element) on your phone and computer.

Create an account on a server of your choice (or run your own).

Invite three people you trust.

Your messages are end-to-end encrypted, you can always move, and your data remains yours.

WhatsApp is not inevitable — it is just still normal.
