# Thesis 26 – Pay the builders of the open internet

[**GitHub Sponsors**](/en/concepts/github-sponsors), [**Open Collective**](/en/concepts/open-collective), [**Liberapay**](/en/concepts/liberapay), [**Patreon**](/en/concepts/patreon), or a direct [**Lightning zap**](/en/concepts/lightning-zap).

The people who build [**Mastodon**](/en/concepts/mastodon), [**Matrix**](/en/concepts/matrix), [**Nostr**](/en/concepts/nostr), [**IPFS**](/en/concepts/ipfs), and [**PeerTube**](/en/concepts/peertube) don't earn their living from ads or investors, but from you and me.
