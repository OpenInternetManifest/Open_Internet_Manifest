The fediverse is waiting for you — and it's easier than you think.

Choose a server that suits you and create your account in 15 minutes:
- <a href="https://mastodon.social" target="_blank">mastodon.social</a> – large general community
- <a href="https://fosstodon.org" target="_blank">fosstodon.org</a> – focus on open-source and tech
- <a href="https://chaos.social" target="_blank">chaos.social</a> – active, free, and privacy-friendly

**Follow this step-by-step guide for a smooth start:**
