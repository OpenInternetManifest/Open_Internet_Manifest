# Thesis 23 – Put your photos and files under your own control

Install [**Nextcloud**](/en/concepts/nextcloud), [**ownCloud**](/en/concepts/owncloud), [**Syncthing**](/en/concepts/syncthing) or use [**Proton Drive**](/en/concepts/proton-drive), [**Internxt**](/en/concepts/internxt) or your own [**IPFS pinning service**](/en/concepts/ipfs-pinning).

One weekend of work and your photos, documents, and memories are truly yours again.

You can share them with whoever you want, take them with you wherever you want, and delete them when you want.

No cloud is safer than your own cloud.
