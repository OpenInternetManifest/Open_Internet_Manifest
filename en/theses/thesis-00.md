# Open Internet Manifesto

### 100 theses for a free, open and inalienable internet.

This is not a petition.  
This is not a compromise.  
This is not a temporary protest.

This is a constitution for the internet we almost lost.  
A living document that grows as long as we keep building it.

The theses that follow are not opinions.  
They are principles.  
They are demands.  
They are the line in the sand we will never let be crossed again.

Read them.  
Feel them.  
Then decide which side you’re on.

Because if we do nothing now, in a few years there will be no internet left to save.

Welcome to the beginning.
