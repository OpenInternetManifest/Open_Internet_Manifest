# Thesis 25 – Join (or start) a local community node

Find a [**Mastodon**](/en/concepts/mastodon), [**Matrix**](/en/concepts/matrix), or [**Nostr**](/en/concepts/nostr) group in your city or region.

Or buy a Raspberry Pi and run [**Umbrel**](/en/concepts/umbrel), [**Start9**](/en/concepts/start9), or [**YunoHost**](/en/concepts/yunohost). **Check out the full step-by-step guide, including hardware links →** [build your own Raspberry Pi node](/en/guides/raspberry-pi-node)

One more node is one step closer to an internet that can no longer be turned off.

Start small. Start local. Start today.
