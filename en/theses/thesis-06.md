# Thesis 6

***Exit without building is flight; building without exit is [**collaboration**](/en/concepts/collaboration).***

Those who only complain and walk away from the big platforms disappear into a void where no one ever finds them.

Those who build beautiful new apps and “decentralized” services inside their stores and clouds merely lay a golden floor in their prison.

Both paths lead nowhere: one to irrelevance, the other to strengthening exactly what we are fighting against.

Real change requires one double movement: [**exit**](/en/concepts/exit) from their ecosystems now and putting all our energy into [**building**](/en/concepts/building) a [**new, truly open internet**](/en/concepts/open-internet) that no one can ever close again.
