**Reality vs Narrative** – Fluoride: the narrative finally cracking 🦷☢️
For decades: "fluoride in water is safe and good for teeth". Standard in US public systems, pushed by CDC, ADA, WHO. Criticism? "Conspiracy theorists", "anti-science".
Yesterday (Jan 20, 2026): RFK Jr. announces Trump White House will advise all US water systems to remove fluoride. Reason: industrial waste linked to arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, thyroid disease.
Reality: not conspiracy anymore – studies pile up (Harvard, NIH, Lancet), but narrative held because it was cheap and protected industry. Trump/RFK now break it head-on: "Make America Healthy Again".
In NL: fluoride in toothpaste and some water supplies. Same pattern: "safe" until undeniable.
Open Internet Manifest wants no centralized health narratives dictating what goes in our bodies. A web without monopoly on "science", without hidden interests shaping lives.
