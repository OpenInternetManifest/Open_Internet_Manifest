**Reality vs Narrative** – DHS bill: selective outrage on demand 🚨🇺🇸
House voted last night on massive border security funding. Trump: "must pass". Left: "defund ICE", "terrorizing children", "Liam drama".
CNN: "ICE raids have always been controversial."
Ben Ferguson: "Not really! Under Obama you rode along and it wasn't an issue!"
Reality:
- ICE created in 2003.
- Obama deported ~3 million (more than Trump first term).
- Media mostly silent or rode along.
- Now suddenly "systematic terror" and "children as hostages".
Same tool (ICE arrests, deportations), different framing depending on who's in the White House. Obama = quiet. Trump = outrage.
Narrative isn't about facts – it's about power. Emotion weaponized: a 5-year-old temporarily in protective custody (mother arrested for drugs/violence, child returned to family) becomes "hostage". Facts drowned in feeling.
Open Internet Manifest wants no selective outrage, no gatekeepers deciding what's "controversial". A web where you check history, data and context yourself – no algorithm or media setting the tone.
