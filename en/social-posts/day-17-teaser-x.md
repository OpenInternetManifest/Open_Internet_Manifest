🇬🇧 **Day 17 – A child at school, today** 🌐😔  
Today is January 27.  
Holocaust Remembrance Day.  

But on this day, a mother has to count again how many times her child has been attacked.  

Tomorrow: a story that hurts.  
One you don’t want to hear.  
But one you need to hear.  

Because if this still happens on a day like today…  
something is deeply wrong with what we claim to have "learned".

Open Internet Manifest: facts over feelings. Hashes over narratives.  
Keep watching. 👀
