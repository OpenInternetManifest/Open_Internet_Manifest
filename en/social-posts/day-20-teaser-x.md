🇬🇧 Day 20 Teaser – Tomorrow: the roots no one talks about 🌑📜

Today another narrative about "occupation" and "resistance."
Tomorrow we go deeper.
✨ Much deeper. ✨

🔍 From:

Roman punitive names
7th-century verses
Exodus out of Arab countries
What happens when a regime truly falters
A story that starts with Philistines and ends with pallets of cash.

You don’t want to hear this.
But you need to hear it.

👉 Open Internet Manifest: facts over frames.
Hashes over stories.
Keep watching. 👀🔍
