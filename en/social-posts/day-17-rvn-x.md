🇬🇧 **Day 17 – Reality vs Narrative: Day 9 Predicted – Walz' Smoke Screens Now Reality** 🌐🔥  
On Day 9 I already warned about daycare fraud in Minnesota and Gov. Tim Walz' passivity:

And in the very first foreword (about Renee/Nicole Good) I wrote how tragic it is that people die for or because of pushed narratives:  
https://openinternetmanifest.org/nl/social-posts/rvn-nicole-good  

I still feel that same pain today: an unarmed American shot during an ICE operation, while the narrative is already primed to frame everything as "racism" or "execution". Families grieve 😔, agents are demonized, and the real context (fraud, resistance, possible threat) disappears behind smoke screens.  

And look what happened next:  
- Late 2025 a viral video exposes empty "daycares" pulling millions in subsidies → federal freeze, DOJ/House Oversight hearings.  
- Walz drops his reelection bid (Jan 5, 2026) under fraud probe pressure.  
- ICE raids target fraud ties + immigration → escalation with shootings (Good, Pretti), protests, clashes.  
- Walz responds with: "Halt the operation", "pull violent untrained agents out" – no call for calm, no "wait for facts", but hard anti-fed rhetoric fueling the fire ("Minnesota has had enough. This is sickening"). 🔥  

Meanwhile Minnesota blocks ICE cooperation for years via sanctuary policies, and DOJ probes Walz & Frey for "conspiracy to impede agents".  

Narrative flipped fast: from "tackle fraud" to "fed Gestapo terrorizes communities". Walz buries the fraud backstory, maximizes only "brutality". Top-tier smoke screens. 🕶️  

It makes me sad: people die on both sides of this narrative – victims of violence, grieving families, agents put in impossible positions. And every time the story wins over raw reality. 😞  

Gatekeepers always choose which fire to extinguish: their side victim, the other perpetrator. Emotion first, facts later.  

That's why I fight with Open Internet Manifest for a web without those smoke screens: I want you and me to check Day 9 vs now ourselves (fraud reports, Walz statements, DOJ probe, video analyses). Hashes don't lie. Narratives do. 🔒  

Walz thought he could steer the narrative – but reality always catches up. And I keep watching, unfiltered. You too? 👀

Why? Because narratives are easily distorted — reality is not.
