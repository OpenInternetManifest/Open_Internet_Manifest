Reality vs. Narrative – The Fixed Pattern in Major Incidents.

The narrative often says:  
“Immediate judgment based on first images: injustice, murder, systemic failure. Facts will come later – or not. Criticizing the victim is victim blaming.”

The narrative often says:  
“Immediate judgment: justified, law & order. Facts? We'll dive in.”

The reality:  
In almost every major incident, we see the same pattern:  
- One side mobilizes instantly on emotion and first footage (“unarmed! murder!”).  
- The other side calls it “justified” and starts analyzing right away: frame-by-frame videos, timelines, witnesses, Graham v. Connor standard, Supreme Court rulings.  
- The emotional side often ignores new facts when they don't fit (or labels them “disinformation”/“victim blaming”).  
- The analytical side adjusts opinion when facts change – but by then the initial narrative is already viral.

Example Renee Good:  
First reaction: “Unarmed, murder by ICE/Trump.”  
Analytical reaction: “Blocked the street, ignored commands, drove forward at agent → deadly weapon, justified force.”

Why this pattern?  
One side prioritizes moral outrage and systemic critique – facts secondary.  
The other side prioritizes individual responsibility and legislation – so they dive deep into details.

Consequence:  
No dialogue, only hate, division, and a truth that surfaces later – but by then the narrative is everywhere.

Choose reality:  
Wait for the facts. Watch ALL videos. Read ALL sources. Adjust your opinion.  
That's real responsibility – regardless of your side.

Will we ever get past this pattern?
