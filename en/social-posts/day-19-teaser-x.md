**Day 18 – Utrecht drama** 🚔😏  
Today, January 29.  
Videos blowing up: cop kicks & hits two Muslim women – narrative: "racism!" & "brutality!". Complaint assault + racism filed.  
Reality? Police: nuisance + insults first, arrest for insult & obstruction, force under review.  

Tomorrow: full context (and why comments full of "brothers").  
Open Internet Manifest: hashes over viral narratives. Facts over frames.  
Keep watching. 👀
