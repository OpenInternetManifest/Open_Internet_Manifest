**Day 36 – RVN: Epstein → Demmink → Baybaşin – the pattern of silence** 🕸️🔇  
Why some cases are never truly solved.

Jeffrey Epstein was no isolated sex offender. He was a node in a network of power, blackmail, and silence. Thousands of hours of video, photos, logs – all meant to bind, break, and silence people. The real story often lies in what is NOT in the files.

In the Netherlands we have a case no one wants to touch: **Joris Demmink** and **Hüseyin Baybaşin**.

**What is verifiable**  
- Demmink was Secretary-General of Justice from 1998 to 2012 – highest civil servant in the ministry.  
- In 2013–2014 two Turkish men filed complaints against him for rape and sexual assault of minors in Turkey in the 1990s.  
- The Public Prosecution Service started a preliminary investigation (2014–2016) → dropped in 2016: “insufficient legal and convincing evidence”.  
- An authentic audio tape (2013) from a Turkish prosecutor mentioning Demmink as suspect was verified by multiple media (RTL, NRC).  
- Turkey summoned Demmink as a suspect in 2014 – the Netherlands did not extradite him.

**Hüseyin Baybaşin** has been serving life in the Netherlands since 1998 (convicted of murder and drug trafficking).  
- Baybaşin himself filed a complaint against Demmink in 2007 for pedophilia.  
- His lawyer Adèle van der Plas claims for years that Turkey blackmailed the Netherlands with Demmink’s alleged abuse to secure Baybaşin’s conviction with fabricated evidence (doctored wiretaps).  
- This claim appears in court documents and was discussed in media (EenVandaag, AD), but has never been proven criminally.

**The pattern**  
- Vulnerable minors from disadvantaged groups  
- Investigations that stop when they reach too high  
- Foreign pressure (Turkey in this case) on the Netherlands  
- A convicted man imprisoned for decades while accusations against the high official are dropped

Just like Epstein and Dutroux: child abuse as an instrument of blackmail and control – and a system that protects itself.

The facts rain is falling now, but the question remains: who filters it? Who decides which pieces get attention and which stay buried?

Tomorrow we continue: which thread do we pull next? Ronald Bernard? Or something new?

Read yourself. Check yourself. Build yourself.  
What silence stands out to you? 🕸️🌱
