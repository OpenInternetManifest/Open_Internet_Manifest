Day 7 – Week Recap & The Promise of Freedom 🇬🇧✨
This week in teasers:
🔹 A Jewish woman in Amsterdam hesitates before saying who she is 😔
🔹 An Iranian woman can't reach her family because the internet is blacked out 🌑
🔹 Creators banned for showing what others hide 🚫
🔹 Blackouts silencing voices, but Starlink offering a lifeline 🛰️
The narrative wants control.
Reality wants freedom 🕊️
In the Bible, Israel is called the Promised Land, and the Jewish people the chosen people.
Not as superiority, but as responsibility: a light for the nations, an example of freedom and covenant with God 🌟
But every promise can be abused.
What if identity is used for power? ⚠️
What if polarization is stoked to pit peoples against each other? 🔥
The Open Internet Manifest advocates for an internet where identity is verifiable, where freedom is not selective, and where boundaries are voluntary and distributed – not centrally imposed 🚀
No gatekeepers deciding who may speak 🚫
No black boxes watching 👀
No manipulation of narratives 🧠
This is not a dream from December 2025.
This is a call for now. 🙏
