🇬🇧 **Day 29 Teaser – Tonight: the circle closes** 🕸️⚫  
Tomorrow: Epstein.  
Not as a standalone scandal, but as the visible tip of everything we’ve covered this week:  
from Sun Tzu to 1913, good cop / bad cop, algorithmic polarization… to systematic blackmail as a control mechanism.  
Pizzagate (2016) was the first wave of suspicion. Epstein made it concrete – yet even then the core remained protected.

Tonight: just breathe.  
Tomorrow morning the full RVN.  
Facts over frames. No hate. No illusions. Only reality.

And we’re not standing still:  
the **comment section** (Giscus) is now live on almost all pages  
→ reply directly under every thesis, guide and RVN post  
→ no algorithm, no gatekeeper – just open conversation
