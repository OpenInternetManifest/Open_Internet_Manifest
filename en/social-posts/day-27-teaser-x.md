🇬🇧 **Day 26 Teaser – Tonight: just breathe** 😏🍿  
**Tomorrow RVN (Saturday): the three invisible layers keeping it all together** 🕸️🔍

From 1913 to today: power has been centralizing for over 100 years.  
But who keeps this system running so smoothly?

Tomorrow we dive into the three mechanisms quietly holding it in place:  

- intelligence agencies that don’t just observe — they actively shape narratives  
- NGOs and philanthropy as untouchable moral authorities  
- algorithms deliberately maximizing polarization  

Why does division work so perfectly?  
Who really benefits from permanent opposition?
Facts only — no wild theories. Just the questions that follow.  
Facts over frames. Stay tuned.
