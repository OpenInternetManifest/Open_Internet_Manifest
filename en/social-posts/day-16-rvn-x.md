🇬🇧 **Day 16 – Reality vs Narrative: The 'mostly peaceful' pattern & the hypocrisy** 🌐🔥  
Overnight & yesterday: Minneapolis boils after Alex Pretti (37, ICU nurse, phone in hand per witnesses/videos) shot by Border Patrol/ICE. Parents call it execution, ACLU suits ongoing, protests escalating. Follows Renee Good (Jan 7, unarmed US citizen, shot in vehicle by ICE).  

Dominant narrative: "mostly peaceful protests" for accountability, "systemic overreach", "Trump's Gestapo". Media pushes emotional march footage, outrage at feds, calls for ICE out of MN.  

Reality?  
The pattern repeats for years – and the hypocrisy is massive:  
- **George Floyd (2020)**: protests labeled "mostly peaceful" (CNN live with burning buildings behind). 93% peaceful per ACLED, but billions in damage, deaths, riots in dozens of cities – narrative focused on justice, downplayed arson/looting as "fringe".  
- **Kyle Rittenhouse (Kenosha 2020)**: protests after Jacob Blake shooting framed "mostly peaceful", but escalated to deadly clashes. Rittenhouse shot in self-defense (acquitted), but narrative: "vigilante killer" vs reality: chased & threatened. Media minimized protester violence.  
- **Renee Good & Alex Pretti (2026)**: protests after ICE shootings "peaceful marches" for justice. Reality: clashes, HSI agent finger bitten off, Antifa-style calls for "guerrilla war", mall shutdowns, National Guard standby. DHS claims armed threats/justified force; videos disputed.  
- **Dutch corona protests (2020-2022)**: "wappies" (anti-lockdown protesters) beaten hard by police – batons, water cannons, warning shots in Rotterdam/The Hague, mass arrests, "pure violence" by "idiots" (Rutte). Corona believers cheered: "own fault, thick bult", "violence against law enforcement". Now at anti-ICE or BLM-style protests? Police suddenly the big villain, systemic issue, protesters "mostly peaceful" despite escalation. Narrative always flips: whatever suits "their side" gets a pass, the other gets blamed.  

Why this pattern?  
Left/protest side mobilizes on moral outrage & victim narrative – their side's violence becomes "mostly peaceful" or "understandable anger". Mainstream amplifies, suppresses counter-evidence as "disinfo". Other side dives into facts (self-defense, probable cause, Graham v. Connor), but narrative already viral. Result: no nuance, just polarization – protests escalate, reality buried under framing.  

Why crucial for Open Internet?  
Gatekeepers (Big Tech + legacy media) decide what "mostly peaceful" means: outrage goes viral, nuance gets shadow-banned. No algorithms pushing all sides – just dominant narrative.  
Open Internet Manifest fights for a web where you check videos yourself (Pretti phone footage, Rittenhouse trial, Floyd riots damage, Rotterdam water cannon clips), verify hashes, judge – without gatekeepers hiding hypocrisy.  

If you're tired of selective outrage... wait for facts, dig deeper.
