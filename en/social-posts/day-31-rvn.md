**Day 31 – RVN: Words don’t count for what they literally say anymore, but for the narrative they create** ⚖️🌀  
Why a judge admits: no direct call to violence... but still guilty.

We took a break. Good for the soul ⚡, good for the site. Back now with something straight to the heart of the series: narrative control on steroids.

Look at Gideon van Meijeren.  
MP (FvD), convicted June 2024 to 200 hours community service for "incitement" – speech at farmers protest Tuil (2022) + interview on "revolutionary resistance" and marching to parliament. Always added: peaceful, non-violent, no violence.

The court explicitly acknowledged: Van Meijeren did **not literally** call for violence. He repeatedly emphasized the opposite. Still guilty. Why?  
Because his words, in the context of angry farmers, could feed a "narrative" – a story others might interpret as a call to violence. Not what he said, but what the public **could take from it**. That weighed heavier.

Appeal heard late January 2026 (28-29 Jan). OM demands again 200 hours. Ruling March 5. In alternative media: judge admits no direct incitement, but convicts on "a narrative". Precedent criminalizing words based on possible reception, not literal content.

This is no isolated case. Fits the pattern:  
- Farmers protests framed as "extremism" while peaceful blockades were core 🌾  
- Good/bad cop: state as order protector, dissidents as threat 👮‍♂️ vs. citizen  
- Algorithmic polarization: narratives isolating and delegitimizing opposition 📱  
- Epstein as symptom: systems ignore facts for controlled story 🕳️

When free speech depends on how a judge thinks the public "might interpret" something... where is Article 7 Constitution? Where real opposition? The line shifts from acts to projected intent. To narrative control.

Van Meijeren calls it a "political show trial" undermining democracy. Agree or not: this hits the manifest core. Who decides which story is allowed? Who weighs words on literal meaning vs. "dangerous potential"?

Tomorrow: how this mechanism works in courts, media, tech – and who the new priests enforcing it are 🧑‍⚖️🔥.  
Day after: Sun Tzu in full play – Epstein files as a boomerang flying back.

For now: read the speeches yourself (not just headlines). What do you hear? What does the system want you to hear? 🤔
