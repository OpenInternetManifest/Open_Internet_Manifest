**Day 20 – Utrecht Bollendak: viral clip vs reality + spun narrative** 🚔🔍  
Videos exploding: cop kicks Muslim woman in stomach, hits other with baton – narrative: "racism! police brutality against Muslim women!" Assault + racism complaint filed, protests follow, massive outrage and calls to action.

Reality (police update Jan 28-30):  
- Nuisance incident with group of ~20 under Bollendak/Hoog Catharijne.  
- Officer arrested 23-year-old woman for insult/abuse.  
- 39-year-old man obstructed arrest → also detained (insult + obstruction).  
- Force under review (CCTV, witnesses, medical care provided), shocking images taken seriously, but prior context matters. No confirmed shoplifting (only rumors).

Double standard in framing:  
During corona protests (2020-2022) police often hit harder (water cannon to the head, batons, dogs – even against people walking away or peaceful field gatherings). Public reaction then: "own fault thick bumb", "should have hit harder", "they asked for it" – little empathy, even with diverse participants (conservative gays, people of color). Now full outrage over excessive force. Why the flip?

Same pattern in the US:  
- Jan 6 Capitol: peaceful outside, breach inside → "white insurrection", "attack on democracy", massive prosecutions.  
- George Floyd riots: cities burning → "mostly peaceful", "understandable anger".  
- Alex Pretti (ICU nurse shot by Border Patrol Jan 2026): videos show spitting + kicking ICE vehicle tail light 11 days earlier → tackled; narrative: "innocent victim of ICE violence".  

Why does framing always land on shaming "white guilt" or collective white shame? Reality is more diverse (participants, motives, context) – but narrative reduces it to one frame. Check facts instead of swallowing spun stories.

Why OIM material?  
Viral clips + selective outrage strip away context. Hashes let you verify yourself, not ride the narrative wave.  

In comments: more on corona/US comparison + why framing is so predictable.
