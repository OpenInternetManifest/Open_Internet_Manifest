🇬🇧 **Day 24 Teaser – Tonight: just breathe** 😏🍿  
Earlier: 1913. Titanic clears opponents, FED and income tax pushed through, Rockefellers build on.  
Today: Knights Templar – first international banking system, power above church and kings, dissolved but structure survived.  
Coincidence? Or a pattern running for centuries?

Tonight: just breathe.  
Tomorrow: back at it.

Tomorrow we look at a modern example of the same game.  
Obama and the Iran deal: $1.7 billion cash, billions in assets unfrozen, proxies stronger, conflict as business model.  
Good cop / bad cop — but who really wins?
