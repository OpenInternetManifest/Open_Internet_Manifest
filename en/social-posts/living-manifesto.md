# The RVN Series is Alive

This is not an end.  
This is a beginning.

Over the past weeks you have read dozens of RVN posts.  
From historical power structures and monetary centralization, through gatekeepers and narrative manipulation, to the contemporary mechanisms that keep division alive and reality subordinate to the story.

But it doesn’t stop here.  
Never.

This series began in early December 2025 when we first put the initial theses online.  
The Open Internet Manifest started with a simple question:  
why has the internet become so closed, why are there gatekeepers everywhere, why is privacy now merely an expectation instead of a right?

Together we wrote the first 30 theses — the foundation.  
Then came the glossary, the practical guides (running your own node, Umbrel, Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale), and eventually this daily rhythm:

- every evening at 19:00 a short teaser  
- every morning a deeper RVN post  

What started as a website grew into an ongoing conversation.  
An open notebook. A living document.

**The next RVN posts are already in the works.**  
Some by me.  
Some by you.

Want to co-write?  
Want to share an angle I missed?  
Make a connection? Bring a fact? Ask a question everyone should actually be asking?  
Or even write your own RVN-style reflection?

Then you’re exactly in the right place.

This series only ends when the narrative is fully broken and facts stand above frames again.  
When the internet is once more open, neutral and sovereign — without gatekeepers deciding what you may see, say or store.

That moment we determine together.

Thank you for traveling with us these weeks.  
Now it’s up to you to write the next line.
