English summary:
Reality vs. Narrative – The Open Internet Manifest (Iran focus).
Narrative: Censorship & blackouts are sometimes necessary for order.
Reality: Iran's total internet shutdown since Jan 8 crushes protests – that's what happens when information control wins. If the dark web is the only free space left, the regular web is already a cage.
The OIM demands: digital rights must mirror real-life constitutional rights (free speech, privacy, assembly, anonymity) – no exceptions, no blackouts.
Teasers tonight 19:00 CET – join to fight for a truly open, uncensored internet.
