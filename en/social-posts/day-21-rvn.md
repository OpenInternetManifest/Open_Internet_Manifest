🇬🇧 **Day 21 – Israel-Palestine & Iran: historical, religious roots vs modern narrative** 🕊️📜
When people reduce the Israel-Palestine conflict and Iran’s role to “occupation since 1948” or “European colonialism”, they miss the deeper picture. The roots go back centuries – historical, political and religious – and today’s layer involves US funding policies and the possible fall of the Iranian regime.
The common narrative: Palestine was always Arab and Islamic land, Jews were European colonizers who took it after 1948. US deals with Iran (Obama/Biden) brought peace and stability, Trump only escalated. The Iranian regime is invincible, its proxies fight “resistance” against imperialism. Religion is secondary or misused.
But go back in time and a different story emerges.
The name “Palestine” (Falestina in Arabic – no ‘P’) doesn’t come from the Arab world. The Greeks called the coastal area Palaistinē in the 5th century BC, after the Philistines – a sea people from the Aegean, not Arabs. After the Bar Kochba revolt (132–136 AD), the Romans deliberately renamed Judea to Syria Palaestina to erase the Jewish connection. It was a punitive name change, not an Arab heritage.
From 1516 to 1917 the area was part of the Ottoman Empire – Turkish-controlled provinces, no independent Palestine. After World War I it became the British Mandate (1920–1948). The Balfour Declaration (1917) supported a Jewish national home, and Jews legally bought land from Ottoman and Arab owners. Demographics shifted through immigration waves.
What is often left out: Jews had lived in the Middle East for thousands of years – long before Islam. After 1948, between 850,000 and 900,000 Jews were forced out of Arab countries through pogroms, confiscation and rising Islamism/nationalism.
- Iraq: ~135,000 Jews in 1948 → after the Farhud pogrom (1941) and laws in 1950–51, ~120,000 fled to Israel (Operation Ezra & Nehemiah).
- Egypt: ~75,000–80,000 → mass expulsion after Suez 1956/1967.
Today nearly half of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi or Sephardi – descendants of those refugees from Arab countries. The story of “only European colonizers” simply doesn’t hold.
And inside Israel? About 21% of the population (~2.1 million people) is Arab, mostly Muslim. They have full citizenship: voting rights, parties in the Knesset, access to education, healthcare and religious freedom – something unique in the region.
Then the religious foundation, almost never seriously discussed. The Old Testament (shared by Judaism, Christianity and Islam) is raw: conquest of Canaan, wars against Philistines and Amalekites, eternal land promises to Abraham. The New Testament breaks with that: Jesus teaches “love your enemies”, dies for the sins of others, focuses on an inner kingdom rather than territorial conquest.
The Quran appears in the 7th century (610–632 AD). It recognizes many Old Testament figures but claims Jews and Christians corrupted the texts. At the same time it builds on Old Testament themes, but much rawer and more expansionist: strong emphasis on jihad (struggle in God’s way), subjugation of non-Muslims (Sura 9:29: fight the People of the Book until they pay jizya; Sura 8:39: fight until religion is only for Allah), and the division between Dar al-Islam (house of Islam) and Dar al-Harb (house of war). That laid the groundwork for centuries of expansion through caliphates, and today Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRGC quote those verses to justify “resistance” against Israel on “Islamic land”.
Why is this often ignored? It doesn’t fit the secular, post-colonial story of “land theft by colonizers”. Iran and its proxies see the conflict explicitly as defensive jihad – not just political, but religious.
US policy adds another layer. Under Obama in 2016, $400 million in cash (pallets) went to Iran as part of a $1.7 billion settlement for an old arms deal, plus the JCPOA released tens of billions in frozen assets (estimates $50–150 billion net usable). Critics say much of that money flowed to proxies (Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis). Under Biden: $6 billion in a prisoner swap (Qatar-managed) and $10 billion in Iraq electricity waivers (convertible). Total ~$16 billion accessible – critics argue it funds the Houthis (Iran reportedly gives ~$100 million/year to Hamas, $700 million to Hezbollah). Under Trump: JCPOA abandoned, maximum sanctions, Soleimani killed in 2020. No cash flows. Coincidence or not: the world seemed quieter on terrorism? ISIS caliphate defeated, Abraham Accords signed, fewer major attacks.
Finally a subtle backfire moment: the Iranian regime is in deep crisis. Protests since late 2025 are the largest since Mahsa Amini – economy collapsing (rial at all-time low, inflation 60%+, bazaars closing), repression only fueling more anger. Analysts call it a “zombie regime”: barely governing, but not yet collapsed. After Khamenei’s death, change is seen as inevitable – “no scenario survives 2026 intact”. Trump is building an armada and saying “time running out”. If the Islamic regime falls, funding and arming of Hamas, Hezbollah and Houthis dries up. Reality (internal collapse + external pressure) may prove true where the narrative of “eternal power” fails. Hashes and OIM show: facts work, even when the narrative doesn’t want to see it.
Facts over feelings. This conflict is history, exodus, religious ideology, cash flows and regime crisis. Not just “occupation”.
Why OIM?
Narratives avoid the depth because it doesn’t fit the story. Hashes let you check sources yourself: Quran/OT verses, exodus numbers, JCPOA details, protest updates, EU IRGC terror list (Jan 2026).
In comments: specific verses, maps, cash figures.
