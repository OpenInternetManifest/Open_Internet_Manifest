🇬🇧 Day 9 – What are Graduated Animal Farms?  

The term comes from alternative circles and is a nod to George Orwell's Animal Farm 📖: a revolution hijacked by a new elite.  

"Graduated" means: multiple layers. Each layer gives you just enough "truth" to feel awake – but you only step into a new, nicer stall.  

The manager always claims: "Trust me, the science is settled, I have the only real truth."  

But real science is humble: it tries to disprove itself to reach better insights.  

The best way to spot if you're in such a farm?  
Look precisely at what is systematically not being said 🤔 

The Open Internet Manifest does not want a new stall.  
It wants a web where no one has monopoly on truth.
