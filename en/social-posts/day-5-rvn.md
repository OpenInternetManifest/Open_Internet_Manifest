Reality vs. Narrative – Starlink Free for Iran.
The narrative says:
“Satellite internet like Starlink is dangerous. It undermines regimes and causes instability. Governments have the right to block access for security and order.”
The reality:
Iran's internet has been largely blacked out for weeks. People can't reach family, coordinate protests, or show the world what's happening.
Yesterday, Elon Musk announced: Starlink is now **free** for people in Iran.
But now the real story from inside (see screenshot): the regime is going **door-to-door**, confiscating satellite dishes and Starlink terminals – just like in the early 2000s. People are risking everything to get a message out.
The narrative says:
“This is interference, illegal, dangerous.”
The reality:
A normal person in Amsterdam with Iranian roots can now perhaps reconnect with family trapped in the dark.
A dissident can post without the mullahs pulling the plug – unless they come take your dish.
This is exactly what the Open Internet Manifest stands for: information and connection as a constitutional right – not a privilege controlled by regimes or corporations.
The narrative wants control.
Reality wants freedom.
Choose reality:
Support initiatives that break blackouts.
Support the Open Internet Manifest for a world where no one is cut off because a regime flips a switch.
Thank you, Elon – and to all Iranians: keep fighting.
What internet do you want: a blackout or an open line?
