**Reality vs Narrative** – From "talking shop" across Europe to real power center 🕶️❄️
For years, Davos/WEF was dismissed in the Netherlands and across Europe as a mere **talking shop**: elites sipping champagne, making empty promises on a Swiss mountain. Rutte himself called it "just a talk club" – harmless networking, nothing more.
Now? Trump leaks private texts from Rutte ("Dear Donald, incredible... committed on Greenland... Yours, Mark") and Macron ("My friend... I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland... G7 in Paris?").
He pushes Greenland with AI memes (US flag, Est. 2026), threatens 10-200% tariffs on EU countries, and forces side meetings in Davos.
Europe counters with theater: Germany sends 13 soldiers on "recon" (back in 24h), France 15.
Macron plays bad cop: tough talk on "respect over bullies" and "no to new colonialism"... while wearing aviator shades **indoors**. Official "harmless eye condition", but memes explode: Eye of the Tiger, Bond-villain, hiding weakness? 🕶️😂
Good cop Rutte flatters privately, bad cop Macron puts on shades – but Trump leaks the script.
And yesterday, just before departure: Trump holds up mugshots of "criminal illegal aliens" arrested in Minnesota – "murderers, drug lords, mentally insane" who "make Hells Angels look like the sweetest people on Earth". Thousands of arrests, photos shown one by one.
Sun Tzu playbook: deception, expose the roles, watch them stumble. From talking shop to power hub in one week – while visually showing "the monsters" he is sending back.
Sometimes you can't just tell people. They have to see it themselves – including those pilot shades.
We want an open web **without sunglasses** – no censorship on truth, no monopoly on info, no double tongues or hidden eyes we have to unmask ourselves. No pilot shades to hide weakness.
