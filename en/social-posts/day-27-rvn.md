**Reality vs Narrative: Politics – from ‘affairs of the citizen’ to theater… and why that difference matters ♟️🗳️🪞🙏**

This week we’ve peeled back the layers:

- Day 22: Warp Speed / Trump → asymmetric play, Sun Tzu in action, exit-ramp without frontal clash  
- Day 23: 1913 → the blueprint (Titanic clears opponents, FED + income tax pushed through, Rockefellers build on)  
- Day 24: Templars → ancient prototype of banking power abuse (above church & kings), religion as system vs personal faith  
- Day 25: Obama / Iran → $1.7 billion cash + billions unfrozen → proxies stronger → conflict as business model  
- Day 26: the invisible layer above → Big Three (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) + BIS + family offices holding the real buttons  

Today: politics itself.

Last week again:  
“You still believe in politics.” 😏  
As if politics is inherently a lie.  
As if voting = consenting to the matrix.  
As if the only option is to passively shout from the sidelines what’s all wrong.

But let’s go back to the origin.  
The word politics comes from Greek “politika” — affairs of the polis.  
The polis = the community, the city, the citizens.  
It’s about how people live together, make decisions, take responsibility for the whole.  
That is not a conspiracy.  
That is not an illusion.  
That is the foundation of living together as free people.

The current execution?  
Yes, it’s often corrupt.  
Theater.  
Deep state layer.  
Lobbyists.  
Party interests above citizen interests.  
I see it too.  
It bothers me too.

But that doesn’t make the idea itself bad.  
It makes the execution bad.  
It’s the difference between the original recipe and what has been made of it over the centuries.

Even the Bible refers multiple times to governing structures — without ever using the word “politics”:  
- Moses appointing judges to administer justice (Exodus 18) ⚖️  
- Laws about kings who must rule justly and not be greedy (Deuteronomy 17)  
- Jesus saying: “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s” (Matthew 22) — recognition of worldly authority, but not as ultimate authority  
- Paul in Romans 13: authority is instituted by God, but also limited by God and justice  

These are not approvals of corruption.  
These are calls to responsibility within the world we have.  
Not passively waiting for everything to fix itself.  
Not just complaining.  
But acting, choosing, co-creating — from faith, from conscience.

Because let’s be honest:  
we’ve been sleeping. 😴  
We’ve handed over responsibility for too long.  
We’ve thought for too long that “someone else will fix it”.  
And precisely because of that the structures could be taken over: by lobbyists, by money flows, by ideologies that divide us while we argue over left-right or vax yes/no.

We’ve left the polis — the community — in the hands of others for too long.  
And now we’re surprised the system no longer serves us?

I don’t believe in the current execution of politics.  
I do believe in taking responsibility as a citizen.  
In not handing over affairs of the community.  
In not only seeing what’s wrong, but also asking: what then?

Because if we don’t,  
others determine the story.  
And the narrative moves further away from reality.

Facts over frames.  
Open discussion allowed.  
I’m still learning every day.  
Are you?

What do you think?  
Is politics inherently lost?  
Or is it mainly the execution we need to reclaim — and does that start with ourselves?
