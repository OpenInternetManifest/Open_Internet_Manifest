English summary:
Reality vs. Narrative – A technician in Amsterdam.
Narrative: Internet restrictions are necessary for safety and order.
Reality: A 32-year-old Jewish woman hesitates before saying her background. An Iranian woman in Amsterdam has no contact with family because of a total blackout.
These are everyday people in 2026 Amsterdam. The Open Internet Manifest says: digital rights must mirror real-life constitutional rights – no blackouts, no forced silence.
Which world do you want for your neighbours?
