**Reality vs Narrative** – Benefits Scandal: the farm that won't break 🏛️💔
For years: "no ethnic profiling", "no racism", "mistakes but no intent". Thousands of parents ruined, homes lost, children taken away.
Reality: systematic, deliberate, framed as "risk analysis". Report after report confirms: Tax Authority knew, ministers knew, yet it continued.
In 2026: still no real accountability. Cabinet apologies, but no heads roll, no structural reform, no independent control on algorithms and risk profiles. The machine keeps running, just with a new label.
For victims: trauma that never ends, debts that linger, trust destroyed. For all of us: proof the state can lie, deny, and destroy – and "waking up" often stops at the next layer (new party, new promise, new pen).
Trump assaults deep state narratives in Davos. Here in NL, the benefits farm still stands: the system protects itself, victims pay the price.
Open Internet Manifest wants no pens – a web without centralized control, without algorithms ruining lives, without narrative monopoly.
