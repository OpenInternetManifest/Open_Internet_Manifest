# Mission & Vision

## Mission
The Open Internet Manifest fights for an internet that is ours again: free, open, sovereign, and fully decentralized.  

We want a world where every human (and every AI) has full control over their own data, attention, communication, and identity – without asking permission from gatekeepers, algorithms, governments, or tech giants.

No central wallets. No mandatory digital identity. No black boxes deciding what you see, say, or store.  
Only facts over narrative. Only own nodes, own feeds, own rules.

## Vision
An internet that feels like an open city:  
- Real roads instead of walled gardens  
- Open squares where everyone speaks freely (no shadowbans, no de-platforming)  
- Free paths you choose yourself, without anyone watching or routing you  

We envision a future where:  
- Every household runs its own sovereign node (Raspberry Pi, Umbrel, redundant backups)  
- Information is cryptographically verifiable (hashes, git commits, zero-trust)  
- Attention is ours again (no dopamine loops, no algorithmic polarization)  
- Complexity and overhead are hated – just like in the Accu-Manifest: create real value, not bill bureaucracy  
- Communities grow organically: start small, stay local, scale only when natural  

We’re not building a utopian dream. We’re building tools and principles that already work: Giscus for open conversation without gatekeepers, own nodes for data sovereignty, RVN series for facts over frames, verification to earn trust, not enforce it.

## Why this is urgent
The current system concentrates power in fewer and fewer hands: Big Tech, governments, private equity.  
It sows division (narrative of narratives), steals attention, and makes us dependent.  
But dependency is not inevitable – it’s a choice. And we choose differently.

## A Digital Constitution – within national borders, but rising above them ⚖️🌐

We, free individuals and communities, recognize that the digital realm is a new space where traditional fundamental rights must be reaffirmed and expanded. Within the physical borders of our nation-states, we build a parallel digital order based on sovereignty, mathematics, and voluntariness.

This is not a call to break laws. It is a call to build a parallel, sovereign digital ecosystem within those laws – a **digital constitution** for people who choose to live this way.

**Article 1: Sovereignty over own data & AI**  
Every human (and every AI) has the inalienable right to full control over their own data, attention, digital identity, and AI systems.  
- No mandatory cloud AI or central models that monitor, predict, or censor behavior.  
- Own models (local on node) or open-source models with full transparency (weights, training data, prompts).  
- Right to explanation: every AI decision must be traceable, revocable, and controllable.  
- AI may not push narratives without explicit user consent.

**Article 2: No gatekeepers**  
Access to information, communication, and storage must not depend on central platforms, app stores, or identity services. Own nodes, peer-to-peer protocols, and cryptographic verification are the standard.

**Article 3: Freedom of expression without interference**  
Words, images, and code may be shared freely as long as they comply with national laws. No de-platforming, shadowbans, or algorithmic censorship.

**Article 4: Decentralization as duty**  
Dependence on a single provider is a risk. Every household strives for its own infrastructure (node, backups, mesh communication) as the basis for digital autonomy.

**Article 5: Transparency and verification**  
All claims, documents, and updates must be cryptographically verifiable. Trust comes from mathematics, not authority.

**Article 6: Voluntary pact & exit right**  
Participation is voluntary. Anyone may exit at any time without loss of basic rights (data export, no lock-in). Small communities may make their own sub-rules as long as they stay within national laws.

**Article 7: Decentralized dispute resolution**  
Conflicts are resolved through cryptographically verifiable agreements or community arbitration – no appeal to state or Big Tech for digital disputes.

This pact is similar to cooperatives or religious communities within a country: within the law, but with own rules.  
Practical example: you run your own Umbrel node → within Dutch law, but your data is not with Google/Apple. You communicate via Matrix → encrypted, decentralized, no central server watching.

This is the next step: from manifesto to **constitutional practice**.  
Not waiting for The Hague or Brussels. Build ourselves, govern ourselves – within borders, but rising above them.

Who signs on?  
(Figuratively – by setting up your own node and linking to this manifesto.)
