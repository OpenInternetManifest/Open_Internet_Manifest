# THE ACCU-MANIFEST 2025  
The true mother of the Open Internet Manifest  
(written in November 2025 – when an empty battery changed everything)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
🌩️ PART 1 – THE SYMPTOM  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A lease van with a dead battery in the city.  
A €130 part you can replace in 20 minutes.

What really happens:  
manager → scheduling → lease emergency number → roadside assistance → garage closed → replacement van delivered with two people → back to work a day later.

Total:  
±20 man-hours  
€1500–2000 in invoices  
dozens of messages and calls…  

For a €130 battery.

All that “economic activity” creates absolutely nothing.  
It’s pure **parasitic energy**.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
🩸 PART 2 – THE DISEASE  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Baumol’s cost disease + rent-seeking + bureaucracy on steroids.

32–35% of our GDP  
(€350–385 billion per year)  

is pure overhead.

Physical work becomes more efficient (machines, automation).  
Administration, compliance, insurance, software licenses, consultants: only gets more expensive.

Lease company, garage, roadside assistance, software provider, insurer – they all profit from **complexity**, not simplicity.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
💸 PART 3 – WHERE THE MONEY GOES  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Private equity funds  
Software companies  
Consultants  
Insurers  
Real estate offices for offices nobody needs  

People who’ve never held a screwdriver now earn more than those doing the real work.

And all those billions count as “wealth” in the statistics.  
Wealth for whom?

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
🌿 PART 4 – SAME TRICK, GREENER COAT  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

50 MW solar farm:  
Physical cost: ±€30–35 million  

Netherlands pays: €90–140 million  

The rest?  
Subsidy advisors  
Lawyers  
Participation bureaus  
Grid studies  
Banks  
Pension funds  

Less than 40 cents of every euro reaches an actual panel.

Green? Yes.  
Fair? No.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
🚪 PART 5 – NO ESCAPE  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Start as self-employed?  
First pay €25,000–40,000 per year for insurance, certifications, administration, software and taxes… before turning a single screw.

The system has two traps:  

1. Employee → can’t decide anything themselves  
2. Self-employed → must first pay the parasite layer  

No way out.  
Only dependency.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
🌱 PART 6 – HOW IT CAN BE DONE  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Cash & direct payment (no lease, no financing tricks)  
2. Budget + “save it → keep it” at the maker level  
3. Small flat teams (no hierarchy, no manager layer)  
4. Open-book finances (everyone sees where the money goes)  
5. Real profit sharing / cooperative ownership  
6. Free choice of customer & maker (no mandatory chains)  
7. Tax overhead, not labor  
8. Start local, stay small (scale only when it grows organically)

Examples that already work:  
Buurtzorg  
Mondragón  
Countless cash-only companies and small co-ops

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
⚡ AND THEN THIS HAPPENED (living proof – November 2025)  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Message from an old client and entrepreneur:

“First step taken mate, lease is no go from now on”  
“Had quote for 3 new vans, I’ll save a bit longer and buy them”  
“Overhead already low… divided into small crews, each their own leader”  
“Going to arrange real profit sharing with the accountant right away”  
“Good eye-opener your post”  
“Thanks man, this is what it’s about and what a broken battery can bring”

One series of posts.  
One company that immediately dumps lease, buys vans cash and introduces real profit sharing.

The manifest is no longer theory.  
It’s already alive.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  
🚀 THE WAY OUT DOESN’T START IN THE HAGUE – IT HAS ALREADY STARTED  
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Who’s building along?  

Share this.  
Talk about it.  
Start small: pay cash, form small teams, hate overhead, create real value.

This is the mother of the Open Internet Manifest.  
Everything that followed (the site, the nodes, the facts rain) started with an empty battery in Amsterdam.
