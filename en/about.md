# An Internet That Is Ours Again

In the real world, you choose your own path: on foot, by bike, through a park, or along a river.  
On today’s internet, you are teleported in seconds to closed platforms, without knowing who controls the gates and who is watching.

This manifesto wants to change that.

We dream of an internet with **real roads, open squares, and free paths** – decentralized, free, and **owned by the community**.  
No more gatekeepers. No more surveillance. No more black boxes.

This is a **living document**. It grows through your input, ideas, and contributions. Together we build an internet that is ours again.

## Where do you start?

[→ Start reading – thesis 1](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/theses/thesis-00)  
[→ All 100 theses in one overview](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/manifest)

Want to know why we **cryptographically verify** everything (so no one can tamper with the content)?  
[→ Cryptographic hashes explained](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/concepts/cryptographic-hash/)

## Get practical (start today)

[→ Follow the step-by-step guides for Mastodon, Nextcloud, sovereign nodes and more](/Open_Internet_Manifest/en/guides)

This is just the beginning.  
**Join in. Contribute. Make the internet open again.**

## How does the site work?

- Every thesis has **next** and **previous** arrows (right and left on screen)  
- Under each thesis you’ll find links to related **concepts** (explanations of terms) and **guides** (practical steps)  
- At the top left you’ll always see the **← Back** button → it simply takes you back to where you came from  
- The hamburger menu (three lines top right on mobile) gives quick access to all main pages  

Navigate the manifesto in your own way – just like on a free, open internet.

(The discussion and community space can be found at the bottom of every page)
