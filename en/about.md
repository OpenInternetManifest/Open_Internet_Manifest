# An internet that is ours again

In the real world you choose your own route: on foot, by bike, through a park or along a river.  
On the current internet you are slung to closed platforms in seconds, without knowing who controls the gates and who is watching.

This manifesto wants to change that.

We dream of an internet with **real roads, open squares and free paths** – decentralized, free and **owned by the community**.  
No more gatekeepers. No surveillance. No black boxes.

This is a **living document**. It grows through your input, ideas and contributions. Together we build an internet that is ours again.

## How it started – The Accu-Manifest ⚡  
It all started with a dead battery in a lease van in Amsterdam (November 2025). That led to insight into parasitic overhead, bureaucracy and real value creation – the mother of this entire manifesto.

## Where do you start?

[→ Start reading – the first thesis](/en/theses/thesis-00)  
[→ All theses in one overview](/en/manifest)

Want to know why we **cryptographically verify** everything (so no one can tamper with the content)?  
→ [Cryptographic hashes explained](/en/concepts/cryptographic-hash)

## Get practical (start today)

[→ Follow the step-by-step guides for sovereign nodes, Mastodon, Nextcloud and more](/en/guides)

## How does the site work?

- Every thesis has **previous/next arrows** (left/right on screen)  
- In theses you find links to relevant **concepts** (explanations) and **guides** (practical steps)  
- Top left always the **← Back** button – takes you back where you came from  
- Hamburger menu (three lines top right on mobile) gives quick access to everything  

This way you navigate your own way – just like on a free, open internet.
