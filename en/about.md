In the real world, you always know how you got somewhere: on foot, by bike, along a beautiful route or in pouring rain.  
On today’s internet, you’re teleported into a handful of closed amusement parks without knowing who controls the gates.

This manifest wants to return an internet with real roads, squares and paths — an internet where you choose your own route again.

A living manifest for a free, open and decentralized internet — built and owned by the community.
