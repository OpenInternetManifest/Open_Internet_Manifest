# Closed-source AI

Artificial intelligence whose source code, training data, and operation are not public — fully controlled by one company.

Used as a gatekeeper for knowledge, news, and human interaction, without anyone being able to check for bias, censorship, or backdoors.

**Opposite: open-source AI**  
Examples (2025):
- [Llama 3](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/) – open weights from Meta
- [Mistral models](https://mistral.ai/) – open weights, European initiative
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) – run open models locally on your own hardware
- [Hugging Face open repository](https://huggingface.co/models) – thousands of freely available models

These models can be run locally, modified, and audited — without dependence on a single company.
