Cryptocurrency and network designed for fast, low-cost international payments, especially between banks.

Advantages: low costs, high speed, used by financial institutions.

Disadvantages: large pre-mine by Ripple Labs, central control over validators, not fully decentralized – less aligned with inalienable sovereignty.
