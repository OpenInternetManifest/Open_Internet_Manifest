# Thesis 30 – This manifesto is only the beginning

It is not an end point, but an invitation.  
Write along. Translate along. Build along. Live it.  
Because we do not create a free internet by complaining about the old one, but by using a piece of the new one every day.

The door is open.  
Will you walk with us?
