# Thesis 20 – From collecting followers to building real communities

10 million followers you don't know is not power — it is a hostage situation.

A group of 50 to 500 people who trust each other is a community.

[**Nostr circles**](/EN/concepts/nostr-circles), [**Matrix rooms**](/EN/concepts/matrix), small [**Mastodon instances**](/EN/concepts/mastodon), [**Revolt servers**](/EN/concepts/revolt): places where quality comes before quantity again.

Connecting instead of scrolling. Talking instead of performing.
