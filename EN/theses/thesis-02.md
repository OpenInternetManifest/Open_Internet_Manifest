# Thesis 2

Those who have enclosed the open internet now sell you the story that true freedom was something from the eighties — and almost everyone falls for it.

In 1989, you bought a computer, plugged in a cable, dialed a number, and you were online with the whole world — without an [**account**](/EN/concepts/account.md), without permission, without five [**gatekeepers**](/EN/concepts/gatekeepers.md) watching to see if you were allowed.

Today, you buy a phone and you are first a customer of Apple or Google, then a tenant of Meta or Amazon, and only then — if you behave — are you allowed to do something.

They call that chain “[**convenience**](/EN/concepts/convenience.md)” and “[**security**](/EN/concepts/security.md)”, so you forget that freedom was once simple, direct, and without gatekeepers.
