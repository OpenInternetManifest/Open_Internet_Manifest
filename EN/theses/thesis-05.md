# Thesis 5

Only a truly open internet gives you real [**digital freedom**](/EN/concepts/digital-freedom.md) — all other solutions keep you imprisoned.

Stricter [**regulation**](/EN/concepts/regulation.md) of the big platforms just turns your guards into polite guards in uniform.

“Decentralization” within their apps and stores only builds more luxurious cells with better Wi-Fi ([**false decentralization**](/EN/concepts/false-decentralization.md)).

[**Privacy laws**](/EN/concepts/privacy-laws.md) and [**competition rules**](/EN/concepts/competition-rules.md) are bandages on an open wound: they slow the bleeding, but do not heal it.

Real freedom means an internet where you can speak, connect, and create something new without anyone first granting permission — and we can only reclaim that internet by leaving now and building a new, open space together.
