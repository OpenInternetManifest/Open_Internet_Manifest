# Thesis 18 – Searching without Google

Google does not decide what is true — Google decides what you get to see.

[**YaCy**](/EN/concepts/yacy.md), [**SearXNG**](/EN/concepts/searxng.md), [**Stract**](/EN/concepts/stract.md), [**Mojeek**](/EN/concepts/mojeek.md), [**Marginalia**](/EN/concepts/marginalia.md), [**DuckDuckGo**](/EN/concepts/duckduckgo.md), and [**Brave Search**](/EN/concepts/brave-search.md) prove that searching can be neutral and privacy-friendly again.

No ad auction, no filter bubble, no sale of your search behavior.

You only need to choose a search engine that serves you instead of selling you.

# YaCy

Decentralized peer-to-peer search engine.

Everyone can run a node that crawls and shares results — together you build an independent index without a central server.
