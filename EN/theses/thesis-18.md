# Thesis 18 – Searching without Google

Google does not decide what is true — Google decides what you get to see.

[**YaCy**](/EN/concepts/yacy), [**SearXNG**](/EN/concepts/searxng), [**Stract**](/EN/concepts/stract), [**Mojeek**](/EN/concepts/mojeek), [**Marginalia**](/EN/concepts/marginalia), [**DuckDuckGo**](/EN/concepts/duckduckgo), and [**Brave Search**](/EN/concepts/brave-search) prove that searching can be neutral and privacy-friendly again.

No ad auction, no filter bubble, no sale of your search behavior.

You only need to choose a search engine that serves you instead of selling you.
