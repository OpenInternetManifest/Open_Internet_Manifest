# Thesis 13 – Your data belongs to you, not to a platform

With [**Solid**](/EN/concepts/solid.md) (Tim Berners-Lee), [**Nextcloud**](/EN/concepts/nextcloud.md), [**ownCloud**](/EN/concepts/owncloud.md), or your own [**IPFS node**](/EN/concepts/ipfs.md), you decide where your photos, messages, and documents are stored.

You can take them with you, share them with whomever you want, and truly delete them when you want.

[**Data sovereignty**](/EN/concepts/data-sovereignty.md) is not a luxury — it is the foundation of a free digital life.
