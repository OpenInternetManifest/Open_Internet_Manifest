# Thesis 6

***Exit without building is flight; building without exit is [**collaboration**](/EN/concepts/collaboration.md).***

Those who only complain and walk away from the big platforms disappear into a void where no one ever finds them.

Those who build beautiful new apps and “decentralized” services inside their stores and clouds merely lay a golden floor in their prison.

Both paths lead nowhere: one to irrelevance, the other to strengthening exactly what we are fighting against.

Real change requires one double movement: [**exit**](/EN/concepts/exit.md) from their ecosystems now and putting all our energy into [**building**](/EN/concepts/building.md) a [**new, truly open internet**](/EN/concepts/open-internet.md) that no one can ever close again.
