# Thesis 14 – Portable identity and reputation

One digital key ([**Nostr npub**](/EN/concepts/nostr), [**DID**](/EN/concepts/did), [**Keyoxide**](/EN/concepts/keyoxide)) that you take with you everywhere.

No more 27 different accounts, no lock-in, no company that can take away your identity.

You build reputation in one place and it travels with you — as it should.
