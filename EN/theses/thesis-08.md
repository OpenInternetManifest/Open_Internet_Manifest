# Thesis 8

An open internet liberates your voice and your creativity from the arbitrariness of [**gatekeepers**](/EN/concepts/gatekeepers).

Imagine: you build an app that connects small farmers directly with buyers, without a big platform taking commission — and suddenly the [**app store**](/EN/concepts/app-store) refuses it because it competes with their own service.

Imagine: you share a message that doesn’t fit the policy of the moment, and without warning your account disappears with all your contacts, photos, and years of work.

That is not an exception, that is daily reality under their rule: they decide who is heard, who is allowed to earn money, who is allowed to exist.

By building [**open protocols**](/EN/concepts/independent-protocols) and [**independent networks**](/EN/concepts/independent-networks), we create a world in which your idea, your voice, and your creation are yours again — without anyone first having to give permission.
