# Thesis 7

An open internet restores to [**privacy**](/EN/concepts/privacy.md) its old power.

In the real world, you assume that a conversation behind your own door remains yours, that a letter in a sealed envelope is not read by strangers, that you can walk down the street without someone selling your route to the highest bidder.

That expectation is not a luxury; it is a foundation of human dignity — and it is exactly that expectation we have allowed to be taken from us online.

The [**gatekeepers**](/EN/concepts/gatekeepers.md) have convinced us that [**total transparency**](/EN/concepts/total-transparency.md) is the price of connection, that we must beg for crumbs of privacy.

By now building [**free protocols**](/EN/concepts/independent-protocols.md), [**end-to-end encryption**](/EN/concepts/end-to-end-encryption.md), [**decentralized storage**](/EN/concepts/decentralized-storage.md), and [**sovereign nodes**](/EN/concepts/sovereign-node.md), we restore what is natural: a digital world in which privacy is once again simply expected, not fought for.
