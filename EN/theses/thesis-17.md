# Thesis 17 – Video and content without YouTube or TikTok

YouTube and TikTok are not laws of nature, but choices by a handful of companies.

Today you can already host and share videos via [**PeerTube**](/EN/concepts/peertube), [**Grayjay**](/EN/concepts/grayjay), [**Odysee**](/EN/concepts/odysee), [**LBRY**](/EN/concepts/lbry), [**BitChute**](/EN/concepts/bitchute), [**Rumble**](/EN/concepts/rumble), or your own IPFS node.

Your channel remains yours, your viewers follow *you* instead of an algorithm, and no one can wipe you out with one click.

The tools are there. The bandwidth is there. The community is there.  
Only you are missing.
