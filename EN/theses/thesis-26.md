[**GitHub Sponsors**](/EN/concepts/github-sponsors), [**Open Collective**](/EN/concepts/open-collective), [**Liberapay**](/EN/concepts/liberapay), [**Patreon**](/EN/concepts/patreon), or a direct [**Lightning zap**](/EN/concepts/lightning-zap).

The people who build [**Mastodon**](/EN/concepts/mastodon), [**Matrix**](/EN/concepts/matrix), [**Nostr**](/EN/concepts/nostr), [**IPFS**](/EN/concepts/ipfs), and [**PeerTube**](/EN/concepts/peertube) don't earn their living from ads or investors, but from you and me.
