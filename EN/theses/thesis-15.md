# Thesis 15 – Social networks without a central owner

[**Mastodon**](/EN/concepts/mastodon.md), [**Pixelfed**](/EN/concepts/pixelfed.md), [**Lemmy**](/EN/concepts/lemmy.md), [**Friendica**](/EN/concepts/friendica.md), [**Hubzilla**](/EN/concepts/hubzilla.md): you choose your own server (instance) or run it yourself.

You can always move with all your followers, posts, and media — no more hostage-taking.

It already works today for millions of people. The only thing still missing is you and me.
