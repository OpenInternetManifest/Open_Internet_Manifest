# The manifesto is alive

This is not an end  
This is a beginning

You have just read the first 30 theses — the foundation of the Open Internet Manifesto.

But it doesn’t stop here.  
It never will.

This manifesto is **alive**.  
It is not dead text in a book that gathers dust.  
It is a commons, a shared garden that grows as long as we keep tending it.

The next theses are already being written.  
Some by us.  
Some by you.

Want to contribute?  
Submit a thesis, add a guide, translate, declare your support, or build a sovereign node?

Then you’re exactly where you need to be.

This manifesto ends only when the internet is once again fully open, neutral, and inalienable.

And that moment is ours to make.

Thank you for coming this far.  
Now it’s your turn.

— The Open Internet Manifesto  
December 14, 2025 and beyond
